# Contributing to Albion Online Ultimate Resource Hub

We welcome contributions to the Albion Online Ultimate Resource Hub! This guide will help you get started with our unified development and deployment workflow.

## üöÄ Getting Started

### Prerequisites
- Node.js 18+ and Bun (required - we use Bun for all commands)
- Docker & Docker Compose
- Git
- Basic knowledge of Next.js, React, and TypeScript
- Understanding of our deployment architecture (see [Unified Deployment Guide](./UNIFIED-DEPLOYMENT-GUIDE.md))

### Development Setup
1. Fork the repository
2. Clone your fork:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/albion-dashboard.git
   cd albion-dashboard
   ```
3. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   bun install
   ```
4. Set up environment:
   ```bash
   cp scripts/infra/.env.example .env.local
   # Edit .env.local with your configuration
   ```
5. Start development server:
   ```bash
   bun dev
   ```

### Development Environment Options

#### Option 1: Local Development (Recommended)
```bash
# Standard local development
bun dev
```

#### Option 2: Docker Development
```bash
# Full stack with Docker
export DEPLOYMENT_MODE="development"
bash scripts/infra/deploy-unified-enterprise.sh
```

#### Option 3: Staging Environment
```bash
# Deploy to staging for testing
export DEPLOYMENT_MODE="staging"
bash scripts/infra/deploy-unified-enterprise.sh
```

## üìù Development Guidelines

### Code Style & Standards
- **TypeScript**: Use strict mode for all new code
- **Formatting**: Prettier with ESLint enforcement
- **Testing**: Vitest for unit tests, Playwright for E2E
- **Documentation**: Storybook MDX for component documentation
- **Performance**: Maintain Lighthouse scores ‚â•95

### Architecture Principles
- Follow the Phase-by-Phase roadmap structure
- Use specified packages and versions only
- Implement security-first development practices
- Maintain enterprise-grade code quality

### File & Folder Conventions

‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ deploy-staging.yml

```

### Commit Messages
Follow conventional commits format:
- `feat:` for new features
- `fix:` for bug fixes
- `docs:` for documentation changes
- `style:` for formatting changes
- `refactor:` for code refactoring
- `test:` for adding tests
- `chore:` for maintenance tasks
- `infra:` for infrastructure changes
- `deploy:` for deployment-related changes

Example: `feat: add real-time price alerts with WebGL visualization`

### Branch Strategy
- `main`: Production-ready code
- `develop`: Development integration branch
- `staging`: Staging environment branch
- `feature/*`: Feature development branches
- `hotfix/*`: Critical production fixes

## üß™ Testing Requirements

### Test Coverage Standards
- **Unit Tests**: ‚â•90% code coverage required
- **Integration Tests**: All API endpoints
- **E2E Tests**: Critical user flows
- **Performance Tests**: Lighthouse CI integration

### Running Tests
```bash
# Unit tests with Vitest
bun test

# E2E tests with Playwright
bun test:e2e

# Coverage report
bun test:coverage

# Performance tests
bun test:performance

# Infrastructure validation
bun run infra:validate
```

### Writing Tests
- Write tests before implementing features (TDD approach)
- Include edge cases and error scenarios
- Mock external dependencies appropriately
- Document test scenarios clearly

## üöÄ Deployment & CI/CD

### Local Testing
```bash
# Test deployment scripts locally
bash scripts/infra/deploy-unified-enterprise.sh --dry-run

# Validate infrastructure
bun run infra:validate

# Test staging deployment
export DEPLOYMENT_MODE="staging"
bash scripts/infra/deploy-unified-enterprise.sh
```

### CI/CD Pipeline
Our GitHub Actions workflows automatically:
- Validate code quality and tests
- Run infrastructure validation
- Deploy to staging on PR creation
- Deploy to production on merge to main
- Integrate with Coolify for zero-downtime deployments

### Environment-Specific Development
```bash
# Development environment
export NODE_ENV="development"
bun dev

# Staging environment testing
export NODE_ENV="staging"
export DEPLOYMENT_MODE="staging"

# Production-like testing
export NODE_ENV="production"
export DEPLOYMENT_MODE="docker-compose"
```

## üìö Documentation Requirements
